<h3>Playlist Generation using LENS</h3>
</div>
<br>
<div align="left">
As a student at Carnegie Mellon University, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to learn from and work with David Plaut, professor of pyschology with a joint appointment in the Carnegie Mellon Neuroscience Insitute, and the head of the Plaut Lab at CMU. Lens, a <a href="https://ni.cmu.edu/~plaut/Lens/">neural network simulator</a>, was created by a CMU graduate student and is also used at the MIT tedlab. For my research, I used LENS, short for Light Efficient Network Simulator, to create a neural network that generates a playlist of songs, based off an input of one song and influenced by a user's musical taste.
