<h3>Composing Music with Nyquist SAL</h3>
</div>
<br>
<div align="left">
Nyquist, 
found <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rbd/doc/nyquist/part2.html#2">here</a>, 
is described as "a language for sound synthesis and music composition. Unlike score languages that tend to deal only with events, or signal processing languages that tend to deal only with signals and synthesis, Nyquist handles both in a single integrated system." This basically means that signal processing and sound synthesis in Nyquist is more akin to writing programs in Python than it is to creating music with a digital audio workstation (DAW), like GarageBand.
<br><br>
To create my composition using Nyquist, I started with the nineteen second sample loaded into the nyquist IDE, playable below.

<strong>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;100 Grandkids, Mac Miller</strong>
<br>

<br><br>
In order to create the sounds in my final composition, I employed numerous signal processing techniques such as sound-stretching, amplitude modulation, and low-pass filters. Additionally, the creation of my composition was primarily executed using 
multiple functions like the <i>Load Sample</i>.
