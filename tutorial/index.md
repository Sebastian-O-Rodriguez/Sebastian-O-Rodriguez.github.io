<h3>Jupyter Notebook Tutorial: Analyze Song Data</h3>
</div>
<br>
<div align="left">
During my time as an undergraduate, I was fortunate to study under Zico Kolter, Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University, who focuses on machine learning, optimization, and control. Using <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a>, I create a tutorial that helps introduce the reader to the basic methods in gathering, processing, and interpreting datasets of songs.
